# Data Visualisation - Exploration

Now that you've demonstrated your software is setup, and you have the basics of data manipulation, the goal of this assignment is to practice transforming, visualising, and exploring data.

# Mass shootings in the US

In July 2012, in the aftermath of a mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/) published a report on mass shootings in the United States since 1982. Importantly, they provided the underlying data set as [an open-source database](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) for anyone interested in studying and understanding this criminal behavior.

## Obtain the data

## Explore the data

### Specific questions

-   Generate a data frame that summarizes the number of mass shootings per year.

```{r}

mass_shootings_yr <- mass_shootings %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% arrange(desc(year))

skimr::skim(mass_shootings)
```

-   Generate a bar chart that identifies the number of mass shooters associated with each race category. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest and each bar should show its number.

```{r}


mass_shootings %>% mutate(race= case_when(
  is.na(race)   ~ "Unknown", .default = race )) %>%  group_by(race) %>%  summarise(n=n()) %>%   mutate(race = fct_reorder(race,n)) %>% arrange(race) %>% ggplot(aes(x = n, y = race)) +
  geom_col() +
  # add n to each bar
  geom_text(
    aes(label = n, x = n - .25),
    colour = "white",
    size = 5,
    hjust = 1
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16))+
  labs(
    title = "US Shootings Count by Race 1982-2021",
    x= "number of shootings",
    y = NULL)+

  # ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")

```

-   Generate a boxplot visualizing the number of total victims, by type of location.

IK: Pls note that the boxplot requires a continuous entry in one of parameters since it plots distribution parameters. I assume  "total" means distribution.  

```{r}

# The base boxplot with linear y-axis scale
mass_shootings %>%   ggplot(aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16))+
  labs(
    title = "Victims Count in US Shootings by Location Type 1982-2021",
    x= "Location Type",
    y = NULL)+

  # ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
  

# The base boxplot with log2 y-axis scale
mass_shootings %>%   ggplot(aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
 scale_y_continuous(trans="log2") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16))+
  labs(
    title = "Victims Count in US Shootings by Location Type 1982-2021",
    x= "Location Type",
    y = NULL)+

  # ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")

```

-   Redraw the same plot, but remove the Las Vegas Strip massacre from the dataset.

```{r}

# The base boxplot with linear y-axis scale
mass_shootings %>%  filter(case != "Las Vegas Strip massacre") %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16))+
  labs(
    title = "Victims Count in US Shootings by Location Type 1982-2021",
    caption = "Las Vegas Strip massacre is omitted",
    x= "Location Type",
    y = NULL)+

  # ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
  

```

### More open-ended questions

Address the following questions. Generate appropriate figures/tables to support your conclusions.

-   How many white males with prior signs of mental illness initiated a mass shooting after 2000?

IK: there were 22 such incidents 
```{r}
mass_shootings %>%  filter(race == "White",male,prior_mental_illness=="Yes",year >2000 )  %>% count()

```

-   Which month of the year has the most mass shootings? Generate a bar chart sorted in chronological (natural) order (Jan-Feb-Mar- etc) to provide evidence of your answer.

```{r}


mass_shootings  %>%  group_by(month) %>%  summarise(n=n()) %>%    mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.abb) ) %>% arrange(month)  %>%  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = n)) + geom_col() +
  # add n to each bar
  geom_text(
    aes(label = n, y = n - .5),
    colour = "white",
    size = 5,
    hjust = 0.5
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16))+
  labs(
    title = "US Shootings Count by Month 1982-2021",
    y= "number of shootings",
    x = NULL)+

  # ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")

# mutate(race = fct_reorder(race,n)) %>%

```

-   How does the distribution of mass shooting fatalities differ between White and Black shooters? What about White and Latino shooters?

IK: 
- It appears that shootings where the perpetrator was white claim more fatalities on average and the distribution has longer tails with many outliers

```{r}


# The base boxplot with log2 y-axis scale
mass_shootings %>%  filter(race %in% c("White","Black","Latino") ) %>%   
 ggplot(aes(x = race, y = fatalities )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
   scale_y_continuous(trans="log2") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16)) +
  labs(title = "Fatalities in US Shootings by Race 1982-2021",
    x= "Race",
    y = NULL) +
# ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
  

```

### Very open-ended

-   Are mass shootings with shooters suffering from mental illness different from mass shootings with no signs of mental illness in the shooter?

IK: There are more mass shooting commited by mentally ill ppl but there are also a lot of missing obs. 
It seems like the number of victims and fatalities is somewhat higher whem perpetrator is mentally ill but the difference would not be statistically significant. 

```{r}

# The base boxplot with log2 y-axis scale
mass_shootings %>% group_by(prior_mental_illness) %>% count()

# Checging fatalities
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = prior_mental_illness, y = fatalities )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
   scale_y_continuous(trans="log2") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16)) +
  labs(title = "Fatalities in US Shootings by Mental Condition 1982-2021",
    x= "Did perpetrator have mental illnes",
    y = NULL) +
# ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")


# Checging total_victims
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = prior_mental_illness, y = total_victims )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
   scale_y_continuous(trans="log2") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16)) +
  labs(title = "Victims in US Shootings by Mental Condition 1982-2021",
    x= "Did perpetrator have mental illnes",
    y = NULL) +
# ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")


# creating a total count of mental illness for rations
mass_shootings_ill <- mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>%  group_by(prior_mental_illness) %>% summarise(illness_total = n())
mass_shootings <- left_join(x=mass_shootings,y=mass_shootings_ill,by ='prior_mental_illness' )


# Checging by race
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% arrange(race,prior_mental_illness) %>%  group_by(race,prior_mental_illness) %>% count()
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% arrange(prior_mental_illness,race) %>%  group_by(prior_mental_illness,race) %>% summarise(n=n(),illness_total=mean(illness_total)) %>% mutate(proportion = n/illness_total)


# Checging by location type
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% arrange(prior_mental_illness,location_type) %>%  group_by(prior_mental_illness,location_type) %>% summarise(n=n(),illness_total=mean(illness_total)) %>% mutate(proportion = n/illness_total)

# Checging fatalities
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% group_by(prior_mental_illness) %>%  summarise(mean_age = mean(age_of_shooter))

# dropping added variable
mass_shootings = select(mass_shootings, -illness_total)

```

-   Assess the relationship between mental illness and total victims, mental illness and location type, and the intersection of all three variables.

IK: the number of victims seems to be somewhat larger when the suspect is mentally ill. The number of victims in schools in noticably larger on average when the suspect is mentally ill.


```{r}

# creating a total count of mental illness for rations
mass_shootings_ill <- mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>%  group_by(prior_mental_illness) %>% summarise(illness_total = n())
mass_shootings <- left_join(x=mass_shootings,y=mass_shootings_ill,by ='prior_mental_illness' )


# Checging total_victims
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = prior_mental_illness, y = total_victims )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
   scale_y_continuous(trans="log2") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16)) +
  labs(title = "Victims in US Shootings by Mental Condition 1982-2021",
    x= "Did perpetrator have mental illnes",
    y = NULL) +
# ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")


# Checging by location type count
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% arrange(location_type,prior_mental_illness) %>%  group_by(location_type,prior_mental_illness) %>% count()

# Checging by location type proportion relative to illness status
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% arrange(prior_mental_illness,location_type) %>%  group_by(prior_mental_illness,location_type) %>% summarise(n=n(),illness_total=mean(illness_total)) %>% mutate(proportion = n/illness_total)



# Checging total_victims by mental_illness and 
mass_shootings %>% filter(!is.na(prior_mental_illness)) %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x =  location_type, y = total_victims, fill= prior_mental_illness)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
   scale_y_continuous(trans="log2") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16)) +
  labs(title = "Victims in US Shootings by Mental Condition and Location 1982-2021",
    x= "Location Type",
    y = NULL) +
# ensure title is top-left aligned
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")



# dropping added variable
mass_shootings = select(mass_shootings, -illness_total)

```

Make sure to provide a couple of sentences of written interpretation of your tables/figures. Graphs and tables alone will not be sufficient to answer this question.
